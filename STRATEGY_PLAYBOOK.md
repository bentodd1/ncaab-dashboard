## November Strategies (Early Season / Non-Conference)

### Strategy 1: Minor Conference Underdogs
- **Conference**: Minor

- **Direction**: Underdog (ESPN favoring underdog)
- **Rationale**: Early season, ESPN may have better info on minor conferences than the market

### Strategy 2: All Conference Favorites
- **Conference**: All
- **Edge**: 3+ points
- **Direction**: Favorite (ESPN favoring favorite)
- **Rationale**: Early season favorites tend to cover when ESPN is confident

## December Strategies (Late Non-Conference)

### Strategy 3: Mid-Major & Minor (Both Directions)
- **Conference**: Mid-Major OR Minor
- **Edge**: 3+ points
- **Direction**: Both (Underdog and Favorite)
- **Rationale**: Mid/minor conference games have more market inefficiency in December

---

## January/February Strategies

### ⚠️ AVOID

## March Strategies (Conference Tournaments & NCAA Tournament)

### Strategy 4: Tournament Underdogs
